            <h1>Myiasis: Understanding the Parasitic Infestation</h1>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>What is Myiasis?</h2>
            <p>Myiasis is a parasitic infestation of the body by fly larvae (maggots). It occurs when flies lay eggs on or near wounds, mucous membranes, or body openings, and the larvae hatch and feed on living or dead tissue. This condition is more common in tropical regions but can occur worldwide, particularly in areas with poor hygiene or in cases of neglect.</p>

            <h2>Types of Myiasis</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Obligatory Myiasis:</strong> Larvae require living tissue to develop (e.g., botfly infestations).</li>
                <li><strong>Facultative Myiasis:</strong> Larvae can develop on dead tissue but may infest living tissue opportunistically.</li>
                <li><strong>Accidental Myiasis:</strong> Larvae are ingested accidentally and do not develop in the body.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>Symptoms</h2>
            <p>Symptoms vary depending on the location and severity but may include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Pain, itching, or swelling at the infestation site.</li>
                <li>Visible larvae or maggots in wounds.</li>
                <li>Fever, nausea, or secondary infections.</li>
                <li>In severe cases, tissue destruction or systemic illness.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>Causes and Risk Factors</h2>
            <p>Myiasis is caused by flies from families like Calliphoridae (blowflies), Sarcophagidae (flesh flies), and Oestridae (botflies). Risk factors include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Living in warm, humid climates.</li>
                <li>Open wounds, ulcers, or poor hygiene.</li>
                <li>Neglect in elderly or immunocompromised individuals.</li>
                <li>Travel to endemic areas without proper precautions.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>Diagnosis and Treatment</h2>
            <p>Diagnosis involves visual inspection, imaging (e.g., X-rays), or biopsy. Treatment typically includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Manual removal of larvae under local anesthesia.</li>
                <li>Antibiotics for secondary infections.</li>
                <li>Wound care and hygiene maintenance.</li>
                <li>In severe cases, surgical intervention.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Prevention focuses on wound protection, insect repellents, and sanitation.</p>
